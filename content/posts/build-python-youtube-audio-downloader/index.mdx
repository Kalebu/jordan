Hi guys,

In this article, I will show how you can use python to download a youtube video as audio in a matter of few seconds using **youtube-dl** python wrapper.

Instead of using an online extension with accumulated ads like savenet, why not use your python skills to build your own downloader now.

### Requirements

For you to be able to completely follow this tutorial, you're supposed to have [youtube-dl ](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)installed on your machine.

### Installation

```python
pip install youtube_dl
```

### Basics of youtube-dl

[youtube-dl i](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)s a command-line tool for downloading videos from Youtube and other video sites, it provides a wrapper for python to directly use its functionality within code.

**YouTube-dl** provides a direct way to download the audio from Youtube by specifying the format of output we want for to next command which is downloading.

### Downloading YouTube video as audio

```python
from youtube_dl import YoutubeDL

audio_downloder = YoutubeDL({'format':'bestaudio'})

audio_downloader.extract_info(link to the video)
```

That's how youtube-dl really makes our life easier, from the above concept you can build your own **GUI YouTube downloader** using your favorite framework ranging from [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to [PyQT](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)

Below is a sample command line app that runs an app for downloading YouTube-audio that runs on top youtube-dl, you can twist it the way you want it.


```python
from youtube_dl import YoutubeDL

audio_downloader = YoutubeDL({'format':'bestaudio'})

while True:
    try:
        print('Youtube Downloader'.center(40, '_'))
        URL = input('Enter youtube url :  ')
        audio_downloader.extract_info(URL)
    
    except Exception:  
        print("Couldn\'t download the audio")

    finally:
        option = int(input('\n1.download again \n2.Exit\n\nOption here :'))      
        if option!=1:
            break
```

When you run the above code it will automatically begin downloading the audio from the YouTube video link you provided If available.
